At the young age of 10, she was accepted at the Durban Music & Ballet School training extensively under Duddley Von Loggenburg, Noleen Nicol and Faith Devilliers in the Cecchetti, Vaganova, and Bourneville styles of ballet.  She was promoted to soloist within her first year, performing with the Natal Youth Ballet Company (1985-1990), dancing roles from Graduation Ball, Bourneville Suite, Sleeping Beauty, Jewels, Etudes, and Raymonda.  Receiving many awards, bursaries, and achievements she chose to dance professionally and was accepted by PACT Ballet Company at the early age of 17, where she performed many traditional ballet classics such as: Giselle, Romeo & Juliette, Firebird, Le Papillon, La Fille Mal Gard√©e, War & Peace, various George Balanchine works, Nutcracker, and Swan Lake.  She later went on to tour South Africa with the national musical, Queen at the Opera, which concluded her 8 year professional career in classical ballet.</p></div>
