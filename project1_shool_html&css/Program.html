                    <h5>ISTD Imperial Classical Ballet</h5>
                    <p>The roots of Imperial Classical Ballet stem from the early days of the ISTD and the first
                        written syllabus in 1913
                        which was based on the teaching of the French School from the Paris Opéra. The syllabus has now
                        evolved to promote
                        the English classical style and addresses the changing needs of Ballet dancers today. </p>
